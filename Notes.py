# This is where I'll be taking notes.

# there's += which means to add to a variable. For example:

x = 1
x += 1
print x  # x now = 2

# Then there's -= which means to subtract from a variable

y = 1
y -= 1
print y  # y now = 0

# Greater than and less than are > and <.
# If something is = you use ==. Like 2 - 1 == 1.
# If something is greater than or equal or vice versa: >= or <=.
# != means not equal to.

# multiplication is (*) while exponents is (**)
# division is ( / ) while using % will give you the remainder.

# Boolean operators (and, or, not) turn statements into values of true (1) or false (0)
# "And" means to be true, both statements must be true.
# "Or", either or can be true while the other can be false.
# "Not" means the opposite of the statement. If true, then it's false and vice versa.
# Not is first, And is 2nd, Or is last. NAO. This can be changed with parentheses ()

# "If" is a conditional statement that executes a code if it's true

if 2 > 1:  # remember to keep if lowercase and the colon at the end
    print "poop"  # indent afterwards
else:
    print "I won't be printed"
